It’s true that SEO has become more difficult and more competitive in the last few years, specially after Google rolled out a series of massive changes to its ranking algorithm. There’s a lot of confusion over what’s best practice and what’s out of date. You really need to understand the latest changes to SEO and discover what works best. But that’s just a lot of work, isn’t it? If you follow the new SEO guidelines and optimize your blog posts appropriately, you can certainly drive a lot of free traffic from major search engines to your website or blog even today. It’s entirely doable! Given below are some of the most important tips, in adherence to the latest SEO guidelines, that you should follow to rank each of your blog posts high up in Google search results and drive lots of organic traffic. #1. Focus on Long-Tail Keywords More than 2 million blog posts are published every day, most of them targeting specific set of keywords. Many bloggers simply stuff their blog posts with tons of keywords, which is not a best practice. Don’t overuse keywords in your blog posts because search engines will penalize you for that black-hat tactic. Instead, choose just 1-2 keywords for each blog post that you write. Focusing on 1-2 keywords is a good SEO strategy because it keeps you on track when writing. It enables you to stick to a single topic and enhances the overall value of your blog post. When you target tons of keywords in a blog post, you will ultimately turn that blog post into a chunk of fluffy content. At the same time, focus on long-tail keywords instead of short-tail keywords. Long tail keywords are a) less competitive and b) highly convertible. They bring you exactly the kind of traffic you want. Essential places where you should have keywords include: Title: You must always have the long-tail keywords in the title of your blog post. All you need to remember is that your title isn’t very long. Remember, it’s the title which both search engines and people see at first. Body: You should also include your keywords throughout the blog post you are writing. But you need to be careful with the use of keywords because overusing them will lead to search engine penalties. What you should do is let the keywords flow into your writing naturally. At the same time, you should try to use multiple variations and synonyms of the keywords you have targeted. And all of this is part of the natural writing process, so you won’t have a hard time doing it. URL: Normally, the words included in the title make up the URL. Make sure your URL too contains the keywords you have targeted. Meta Description: Whether it’s Google or people, they come to know about the content of your blog post by going through the meta description which shows in search engine results. It is important that your meta description is appropriately optimized for conversion and contains the keywords. Again, don’t stuff the meta description of your blog posts with keywords because it won’t help. #2. Write for People (not Search Engines) According to modern-day SEO guidelines, you can’t rank a blog post higher in search if you just write to woo search engines. Major search engines like Google favor those blogs or blog posts that address the needs of the target audience through their content. Find out who your target audience is, what their day-to-day needs are and start writing to help them and make their lives easier. When writing for people, you can – > Answer common questions > Teach a new skill > Share an insight > Break the latest industry developments > Provide useful tips Today, you can only rank high by providing original, high quality and value-added content to readers or the target audience. If you focus on solving people’s issues with your content, your content will rank higher. #3. Create Long-Form Blog Posts This is the age of content marketing . Today, businesses are investing in the creation of lots of highly useful content. Therefore, don’t just write short-form blog posts that have around 500-600 words each. Start writing longer posts which contain more than 1000 words. Writing longer posts doesn’t in any way mean creating junk or fluff. Longer posts mean comprehensive, in-depth content. Blog posts that have 1500 words or more are proven to generate a lot of organic traffic – for the long term. First of all, long-form content provides you with a good reason for promotion. Second, comprehensively written blog posts require more reading time, which in turn increase your time on site. Third, longer content pieces immediately attract attention from people on social media. All of this combined together results in the high search engine rankings of your blog posts. Since creating long-form content requires a lot of time and research, it’s highly recommended that you hire professional writers for the job. #4. Link Out to Credible, Useful Resources Gone are the days when bloggers or web-based businesses wouldn’t want to link to external websites for loss of traffic. Today, the rules have changed. To increase the value of your blog posts and achieve high rankings in search results, you need to link out generously. Since people come first, Google wants you to provide readers as much value through your blog content as possible. While it’s a best SEO practice to link out to other resources on the web, what’s even more important is to link to only those resources that are credible and useful. The point is to help readers delve further into the topic at hand. So, the next time you write and publish a blog post, don’t stop yourself from linking out to other good websites and blogs on the web. If you check out the higher ranking blog posts in Google search results, you will find that most of them have at least a couple of outbound links in their content. While linking to external resources, just remember to make the outbound links open in a new tab. #5. Use Categories and Tags Carefully If you are using WordPress for blogging, you are definitely aware of categories and tags. Basically, these are WordPress features that allow you to categorize your blog’s content into various logical groups. Though both categories and tags may seem similar, they are used for different purposes. To improve the SEO of your blog posts and your blog as a whole, you should understand how to use both these features to maximize the benefits. Categories are used to create groups of content that match the primary topic or niche of your blog. If you run a niche-focused blog, you can’t have 30 or 40 categories. In case you have that many categories, you should immediately take a relook at them and reduce them to a smaller number. When you have your blog content scattered across too many categories, ranking high in search becomes harder. On the other hand, tags feature is used to micro-categorize your blog content. You can think of tags as your blog’s index words. While using categories is essential, using tags is not. If you don’t create and add categories to your blog posts, they will be automatically categorized under the ‘Uncategorized’ category. In case you use tags as well, it’s recommended to make them noindex. #6. Link to Internal Pages Internal linking is also of utmost importance as far as optimizing your blog posts for higher rankings in Google is concerned. In the same way as you link out to resources outside your own blog, you should link to the pages on your own blog. So, internal linking should also provide value to the reader. You can link to other relevant blog posts, product pages or landing pages on your blog. #7. Use High Quality Images Good quality images are an essential part of a great blog post. But you have to choose only those images that improve the user experience. Make sure all the images you use in a blog post are of high quality, have the correct aspect ratio, have good resolution and are of a size that could be viewed across a wide range of devices. Always remember to resize your images in Paint or Photoshop so that you don’t end up uploading a huge file on to your blog post. Since huge image files make your site slow, they hurt the search engine rankings directly. Give your images an accurate file or title name and describe them in the alt section without overusing keywords. If you are struggling to rank your blog posts at a higher position in Google search engine results, the tips and guidelines mentioned above will prove to be of great help. Make sure you pay adequate attention to each step so that you can optimize your blog posts as per the new rules of the game and be a winner. Save Share this : 28 Jul 2016 How to Become an Authority Site in Google’s Eyes Search Ranking , Website Guideline Comments Off on How to Become an Authority Site in Google’s Eyes Almost every small business is fighting an uphill battle to rank their site at the top of Google. Creating a site is easy but the challenge is to transform it into an authority site that Google favors. If you are successful in making your site an authority site in Google’s eyes, rankings will come automatically. However, it’s not easy for every small business to build an authority site, particularly because most of them don’t really know what authority in this context actually means. An authority site is a site that people trust and look at as a great source of information and knowledge. Therefore, small businesses that make sites focusing on the authority point gain strategic advantage over the competition. If you’re as big as Amazon or Apple, you won’t have any authority or credibility issues. They are industry leaders and trusted by hundreds of thousands of people all across the world. When you are not a well-known company or business, it really is a challenging task to become an authority in Google’s (or other major search engines’) eyes. But there are some best practices and tips that you can follow to take your site from ordinary to authoritative. Of course, it requires a lot of time and effort to achieve the authority level. But it’s doable, if you are willing to do it. Authority Leads to Higher Google Rankings The best part about building an authority site is that it’s liked by Google more than anything else. If people trust your site and visit it often to gather valuable insights and important pieces of information, Google will know it in no time and will start ranking your site at the top of its search results. You’ll find tons of advice on the web as to how you can improve the rankings of your site or achieve top Google positioning. Some of you also may want to trick the search engines to achieve higher rankings. But the days of black hat SEO techniques are far over. The only way to rank at the top of Google is by following the webmaster guidelines and creating a site the people like so much that they return to it over and over again. And that’s exactly what authority is all about. Therefore, one surefire way to getting ranked at the top of Google search results and maintain the positioning for the long term is by making your site an authority site in Google’s eyes. Build Authority Before It’s Too Late! Pick any niche and you’ll be surprised by the kind of competition you’ll face. Google takes multiple factors into account to determine the authority of a site. Given below are some important tips that you should follow to become an authority site in Google’s eyes and get higher rankings as a result. Web Design Matters: It’s the design of your site that the visitors see at first. It’s the design that makes the very first impression. If your site was designed by an incompetent web design professional or you designed the website yourself (and you are not a designer), the design will suck. Always remember that the way a website or blog is designed has an impact on human behavior. Attractively designed sites create a feeling of trustworthiness among visitors. Make Your Contact Information Easily Visible: Don’t leave people guessing where you are located or whether you have an office. If you want to become an authority, the very first thing you should do is to put your contact information in all those places where visitors may look for it. You should include your contact information in the footer, in the header and if possible in the sidebar as well. Also, the ‘ Contact ‘ link should be placed in your navigation menu. Keep Your Message Relevant: What’s the core message that you want to deliver to visitors or your target audience? First, understand the profile and behavior of visitors and tailor your message in a way that’s relevant to their needs. A website or blog that displays relevant information is always trusted by visitors. Use Simple Language: It’s important to understand that people will not trust what they are unable to understand. You should always speak in a language that’s easy for your audience to understand. Start listening to your audience via social media and find out more about the kind of language they speak and then talk in the same language so that you can become trustworthy. Don’t Make Grammatical Mistakes: Good grammar is one of the most important fundamentals to abide by when you want to build authority. Whether it’s your website or blog, you should make sure that your content is free from any kind of language or grammatical mistakes. Bad grammar and spelling leave a bad impression on visitors and they stop trusting you. Hire professional writers to create error-free content for all sections of your website and blog. Create High Quality Content: Top-notch content is the backbone of a site. Whichever niche you belong to, you should always create content that informs and educates people. Your content should help people with their day-to-day problems, teach people new skills and inspire people to change their lives for the better. If you can’t have your own in-house team of content writers, outsource your content writing tasks to an agency or experienced professionals. If you plan to market your products and services successfully, you can’t afford to ignore creating value-added content . Useful and informative content is your ticket to becoming an authority in Google’s eyes. Link Out Generously: While it’s important to link the pages on your site internally, what’s even more important is to link out to content on authority sites. When you link out to external resources generously, it sends a signal to Google that you really care about offering real value to people. Show Your Client List and Testimonials: When you want to build the authority of your site in Google’s eyes, you should also remember to have a list of clients, testimonials (text or video) available on your site. This is something people expect to see before they decide to do business with you. Also, try to provide some information about the client by linking to their website or organization. Don’t ever make up testimonials of your own because people and search engines can see through the scheme. Create Case Studies: How do you prove that the services you offer will truly bring benefits to people or prospects? Using case studies is an excellent way of showcasing your expertise and creating trust. Publish the case studies on your website or blog to increase trust and become an authority. Improve Site Usability and Accessibility: Can the visitors find easily what they are looking for on your site? Make the navigational structure of your site fully functional and easy to follow. Optimize your site for both desktop and mobile devices. Ensure your site loads really fast. Use Social Media Actively and Effectively: Social signals also play a crucial role in building the authority of a site. If you are on social media already, you should start using it appropriately: post updates regularly, share value-added information, show behind-the-scenes pictures, listen and talk to people. If you aren’t, create social profiles for your company right away because you are already late. At the same, remember to choose only those social media platforms where your audience spends time. And act according to a well-structured strategy. Build High Quality Links: Though creating high quality content consistently will do a good job of attracting high quality links, you should also work out an effective link building strategy because links matter even today. When determining the overall value of a site, Google gives a lot of weight to the link factor. If you haven’t paid attention to the links pointing back to your site yet, maybe it’s time for a backlink audit so that you can clean up and improve your backlink profile. Start a Blog: Since your website mostly contains information about your products and services, you should start a blog to showcase your expertise. Having a blog gives you an excellent opportunity to publish content on a regular basis, let people become aware of what you know, help them improve their lives and ultimately continue building authority in the process. Apart from writing yourself, you can also invite guest authors to share their expert opinions on your blog. Keep Ads to a Minimum: If you display plenty of ads on your site, it clearly shows that the needs of users don’t come first. Stop looking desperate; keep valuable content above the fold. Since lots of ads kill user experience, Google doesn’t like it. If ads are not your main source of income, it’s advisable not to use them at all. Building a site that has authority in Google’s eyes is the most effective way of dominating search engine results for the long term. An authority site will also give your competition a run for their money. Share this : 28 Jun 2016 Importance of Content Marketing – Onsite and Offsite Content Marketing , Content writing Comments Off on Importance of Content Marketing – Onsite and Offsite No matter how hard you try, you can’t turn a blind eye (or a deaf ear) to content marketing. It’s everywhere you turn. Talk about any niche or industry, it’s simply impossible to achieve marketing success without content. Web users, readers or customers are all hungry to devour content that teaches them a new skill, solves their day-to-day problems and answers their key questions. Here are a couple of eye-opening statistics about content marketing: > 60% of marketers create at least one piece of content each day. (Source: eMarketer) > Content marketing costs 62% less than traditional marketing and generates about 3 times as many leads. (Source: DemandMetric) > 93% of B2B marketers use content marketing. (Source: CMI) > Conversion rates are nearly 6x higher for content marketing adopters than non-adopters (2.9% vs 0.5%). (Source: Aberdeen) > 60% of the most effective B2C marketers have a documented content strategy. (Source: CMI) Many businesses have understood the fact that traditional marketing is losing ground by the minute and so they have adopted content marketing. What is Content Marketing? Content marketing is a marketing method which focuses on consistently creating and distributing value-added content to attract a specific audience for driving profitable customer action. The main goal of content marketing is to provide value to the target audience. Therefore, content marketing uses blogs, articles, infographics, podcasts, videos and social media sites as a vehicle to inform, educate and help readers or customers. In fact, content marketing is communication with customers at its best because it excludes selling and delivers information to educate buyers. At the same time, it’s also important to understand that content marketing is NOT sending informational garbage to sell stuff. Companies keep sending information that’s not very relevant or valuable. If you start doing the same in the name of content marketing, you’ll be bound to fail. Remember, content marketing is something that makes a person stop, read, think and behave in a different manner. Why You Should Adopt Content Marketing Content marketing isn’t just a popular term or another marketing technique you may or may not care about. In fact, it’s a critical element in digital marketing. It provides businesses with a number of benefits that can’t be ignored. Important benefits include: > It generates more inbound traffic to your site. > It boosts engagement with the target audience. > It generates more leads. > It increases sales. > It creates brand awareness. > It establishes you as a thought leader. > It is cheaper than traditional marketing forms. Provided you work according to a strategy, content marketing has the potential to breathe new life into your business. It can immediately take your business to a whole new level, leaving competitors far behind. Onsite Content Marketing When starting with content marketing, you should first turn your website into a great content hub. You should make your website a great resource of content that your target audience can use and appreciate. Onsite content marketing tips include: Write for People: Any piece of content that you let go live on your website or blog should address a specific need of your readers or customers. Instead of stuffing your content with keywords, you should make it valuable so that it solves a problem or teaches a new skill to your target audience. Maintain a Consistent Tone: Apart from writing for people (and not search engines), you should also choose a tone that you would like to stick to for the long term. If the tone of your writing isn’t consistent across all the content on your website and blog, it will reflect poorly on your company or brand. On the other hand, keeping your tone consistent will create a unique identity for your company. Create Unique Content: Uniqueness is the soul of content marketing. If you are really serious about marketing your products or services with content, you should make your content unique. Come up with original ideas and topics that not many people are talking about or have talked about yet. Keep Your Content Structured: When your content is structured, users will be able to find it easily online and your employees will be able to redeploy it in a wide range of formats and media types. The main benefit of structured content is that it empowers your content to succeed in the context of any device. Include Meta Data: Make sure every piece of content you publish carries a unique title tag and meta description so that both search engines and people can use it to understand what your content is about. Use Semantic Keywords: Modern-day SEO isn’t about stuffing your content with the same keywords over and over again. Today, you need to cross the basic keyword research boundaries and get into synonym creation, semantic search and semantic themes. Semantics refers to how somebody interprets a word or a term. So, use a lot of synonyms and create supporting keywords. Write Comprehensively: Don’t just write for the sake of writing. When you are creating content, make sure you define a topic really well and include as much information revolving around that topic as possible. Publish Content Regularly: One of the most important onsite content marketing tips is to create and publish content on your website on a regular basis. The best way to keep your website fresh and rich with content is to start blogging. If your website doesn’t have a blog attached to it yet, create it now. Use your blog to publish high quality and value-added content on a regular basis. Effective on-site content marketing will help you build web pages that have authority and resonate with the audience for the long term. Offsite Content Marketing Your website or the blog isn’t the only place where your content should live. It’s important to expand the reach of your content by distributing it via different offsite content marketing channels. At the same time, you should also take the time to create content exclusively for external platforms or websites so that you can improve your marketing and get better results. Offsite content marketing tips include: Change Your Approach to Guest Posting: Create a new, improved strategy for guest posting because it’s not just about finding popular websites and publishing relevant content there. While guest posting, you should choose only those websites that fall within the marketing segment you’re trying to reach. Today, you can’t crank out content in the name of guest posting. Your improved guest posting strategy should focus on creating high quality content that really addresses the needs of the target audience you’re trying to reach, in the same way as you do on-site. Diversify Your Content: Content can take multiple forms and can be created in different formats. So, don’t just depend on how-tos and informative articles. Create videos, infographics, presentations, podcasts, interviews etc. By diversifying your offsite content, you’ll attract more readers and create interest for your brand. Focus on Building Relationships: Your offsite content should not talk business all the time, as it will only drive readers away. Avoid being promotional, and put the audience’s needs at the forefront. Focus on providing content that adds value to the day-to-day lives of your readers or customers. Build your authority. Let your customers or prospects know that there are humans behind your company. Interact with them, answer their questions and be easily available. Use the Right Social Media Platforms: Don’t try to be on all social media platforms because it’s just not possible, especially when you are still growing. Choose the social media sites you want to be on wisely. Find out where your target audiences are hanging out and use only those social media platforms. Content marketing isn’t going anywhere; it’s here to stay for as long as you can imagine. Though content marketing isn’t a modern-day concept, it’s certainly becoming more and more important in the lives of today’s marketers. No matter what products or services you sell, the most effective way to market them is through content. As traditional marketing continues to degrade every day, content marketing is evolving in many new ways and you should be ready to use it as a powerful marketing technique. If you need help working out a well-structured content marketing strategy, don’t hesitate to get in touch with a marketing agency or an experienced professional. Share this : 08 Jun 2016 Rank Brain – Google’s 3rd Most Important Ranking Signal Google News , Ranking Factor Comments Off on Rank Brain – Google’s 3rd Most Important Ranking Signal Google uses as many as 10,000 signals and sub-signals to determine the rankings of web pages in its search results. Don’t believe me? According to Matt Cutts himself, Google has more than 200 ranking signals and many of them have over 50 variations within a single factor. So, if you take 200 signals and multiply by 50, you’ll get the number which I mentioned at the very start. While you may have heard and known about the 200 signals that Google uses to rank its search results, do you know what RankBrain is all about? On October 26, 2015, Google announced a new ranking signal called RankBrain. But it isn’t just any ranking signal. It’s the 3rd most important! Google’s hand-crafted search algorithm got a major overhaul when RankBrain was released. This new ranking signal has simply changed the way Google ranks 30 trillion web pages. Though RankBrain hasn’t replaced the current Google algorithm called Hummingbird, it’s certainly a pretty important signal Google uses. What is RankBrain ? It’s an artificial intelligence system that Google has developed to evaluate web pages for relevance and rank them using a machine learning technology. So, this system is based on computer programs that can teach themselves how to rank search results, without manual assistance. “RankBrain is one of the “hundreds” of signals that go into an algorithm that determines what results appear on a Google search page and where they are ranked,” said Corrado, a senior research scientist at Google. “In the few months it has been deployed, RankBrain has become the third-most important signal contributing to the result of a search query,” he said. Definitely, RankBrain is the 3rd most important signal that Google is already using to rank pages in its search results. By creating this signal, Google is able to filter out those web pages that don’t provide high quality content and aren’t relevant to the search term being queried. What RankBrain Isn’t Since RankBrain is fairly new, people have a lot of misconceptions about it. When you want to have a crystal-clear understanding of what RankBrain really is, it’s helpful to know what it isn’t. Don’t think of RankBrain as a new version of the Google Knowledge Graph. Though Knowledge Graph is also an AI program, it’s not associated with RankBrain by any means. RankBrain is a stand-alone technology. Also RankBrain isn’t a search algorithmic update. So, you shouldn’t look at it they way you look at Panda or Penguin . RankBrain is an important ranking signal which functions in conjunction with Hummingbird, which is Google’s current algorithm, to provide better and more meaningful results. RankBrain isn’t a robot either, as many would believe. Though it’s an artificial intelligence (AI) system, it isn’t conscious. The system is based on a series of mathematical equations that have the capability of learning and improving by themselves, without any human help. How Does RankBrain Work? What RankBrain actually does is that it embeds vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities and then creates a format that a computer can easily understand. And when RankBrain comes across a word or a group of words that it doesn’t know, it will use that information to guess those words or group of words that might be similar in meaning and deliver results accordingly. That’s how RankBrain deals with search queries it hasn’t seen before. For example, searching for “Trump” brings back pages and information that matches “Donald Trump”, a popular presedential candidate for US election 2016. Previously, Google might return you results which contained only the exact word “Trump”. But the RankBrain technology has changed it. Likewise, if you search for “Barack”, you might see pages that talk about “Barack Obama”, “US President”,</str>

This technique of bringing people to your site has been a constant source of success for many websites throughout the years and as concepts are constantly changing, this continues to be a really important way for companies to begin their internet marketing strategy. So what exactly is content marketing? In essence, it is when you publish content online to various different outlets with the intention of providing useful information and also to link back to your site. There are a few reasons why content marketing is so effective. First of all, if the content that you are producing is helpful to people, this gives you a reputation of being a leader in your field and this is important. You want to appear to the community as being someone who knows what they are talking about as this will drive more people to your website and give them confidence when they are looking to purchase something from you or sign up for something. Secondly, a strong piece of content with a link to your website will go a long way. It is important that your content is well written because search engines can tell whether or not your words make sense. Spending the time to write good articles is important, or alternatively hiring someone to write them for you also works. When you write articles with helpful information at the bottom with a link back to your site, not only will people click on this link to learn more information about what you are talking about and your company, but the search engines will also pick up on this link and eventually rank you higher the more articles you write. It is also important that the articles you are writing relate to your website as a whole, otherwise you will not get any click-throughs and the search engines will not reward you. There are many places you can publish content for marketing purposes. Article directories like Ezine Articles is a great place that has many different articles and people go there for information about a lot of things. You can also participate in forums that are related to your niche by answering questions people have online. This will not only help you build links but will quickly establish you as an expert in your area. Social media is also a great place to post content and links. All in all, there are countless ways to approach content marketing but the important thing is that you do approach it. As you can see from the information above, it is a lot of hard work, constant diligence and information gathering but this will pay off for you immensely. Hiring an SEO company like Explode SEO will allow you to take your mind off of it and put it in the hands of someone that truly knows what needs to be done. They can take care of all your article writing needs, ensuring that your time and money is spent doing something useful.

For most companies who start up a website, getting people to their site is a challenge, but solid content writing can help with this. Whether you are writing content on blogs, social media sites or posting in forums, getting your brand out there with helpful information is a great way to start building up your links and increasing your search engine ranking. Writing content seems easy and in some ways it is, but doing it properly is a bit more complicated than it would initially appear. There are a lot of sites out there that give you wrong information on how to do this, and new business owners end up spending a lot of their own time writing content that will only hurt them, not help them. Good content writing is time consuming but in the end, it is definitely worth it. If done properly, good content writing can greatly improve your search engine ranking by building a network of backlinks while also establishing you as an expert in your niche and someone who people can ask for guidance if needed. The content you write needs to be helpful, relevant, well written and provide value to people reading it. If it isn’t well written or doesn’t provide any value, then it is not a good piece of content. Search engines can tell when an article is well written and if it is not, they will likely punish you. If your content is not relevant to your business and does not provide any value to those reading it, you again will likely be punished in the ranking. Deciding where to publish your content is another tricky task that might be best performed by an SEO consulting firm like Explode SEO, who has over a decade of experience doing just that. You will want your content to be posted on relevant blog sites, forum discussing your niche as well as article directories. You want to make sure that wherever you post your content, customers who are potentially interested in your product/service might be able to find it. For example if you are a website selling pet supplies, you will want to make sure you are in forums discussing pet related issues so get your brand out to your target market. Explode SEO can help you get your brand out there by writing and publishing content on your behalf. As mentioned, this process is very time consuming but incredibly necessary if you are looking to rank well with the search engines. Overlooking content publication can be detrimental to websites just starting out so look to hire Explode SEO to manage this important process for you! Request a Quote!

The first battle in having an online presence is to get people to your site. This is accomplished through optimizing your site for SEO, and then getting visibility through search engines and ads to send people to your site. This can be done in many different ways from link building to content generation, but regardless of how you get potential customers to your site, once they are there you would still like them to ‘convert’. This is where conversion optimization comes in. Basically, conversion optimization is improving the functionality of your website as a whole so that the usability facilitates greater conversions (otherwise known as sales, email list sign ups, subscriptions or whatever the end goal of your website is). Regardless of what the conversion goal of your website is, there are several key things to keep in mind when you are looking to optimize this for your specific site. Below is a quick list of things that you might want to keep in mind. Keep the navigation simple. The navigation for your website needs to be simple and easy to follow. If you are looking to sell something, it needs to be very clear how someone can do this, and where they can do it. If people have to look around your website for hours, they will leave and you will not get a conversion after you have worked so hard to get them to your site.

In order for your website to rank well in the search engine rankings you must master the basics of link building. Essentially, link building is where other websites link back to your website. The more organic links you can get that link back to your site, the higher you will be ranked in the search engines. While having a bunch of links linking back to your site is very important, you need to ensure you are link building in the right way. There are good and bad ways to build a link and if you are not sure about which is which, you should contact Explode SEO to help you with your off-site SEO campaign. One method of link building is manual link building, which is where you contact websites to request a link to your site. This is obviously incredibly time consuming and if you are looking to rapidly build your backlinks, this method will take a long time. When you contact websites to ask them to link back to your site, it is important that these sites are somewhat related to the niche that you are trying to target. While it is great having a ton of backlinks to your site, if these links are unrelated then the search engines will pick up on it and you will not be rewarded for this. For example, if you own a sandwich shop in Seattle, you could search “sandwich Seattle” and see what comes up. The first 25 or so sites that come up would be great to contact for link building. Anything where people would see your website on another site and want to click on it would be beneficial. You will likely have to offer a link to their site from your site in order for them to do this. As mentioned this is time-consuming, but these links are very valuable. You can also pay to build links as well. There are websites out there that are devoted to link building where you pay them to have your link appear on relevant websites. This can get pretty expensive very quickly, however it is a lot more efficient in terms of time when it is compared to manual link building. However, you need to be careful when you use this kind of service as some sites are deemed unethical by the search engines and you will be penalized for it. Perhaps the most effective way to build links is through writing content. Posting articles on sites, writing in forums and doing blog posts with a link back to your site are all great ways to build relevant and valuable links. Not only are these links valuable, but you will also appear to be a leader in your field if the articles are helpful to people and if they get something out of it. Posting articles on anywhere from article directory sites to social media sites can help your cause. Link building is imperative if you want your website to be ranked highly in the search engines. Hiring a company like Explode SEO is highly recommended because building links for your site is no easy task. You need someone who is highly competent, committed and knowledgeable about the market and your niche in order to have a successful SEO campaign. With over a decade of search engine optimization experience, Explode SEO can take your website to heights you didn’t even know were possible! Request a Quote!

So how exactly can businesses use Google Maps to get more visitors to their site? First of all, Google Maps obviously enables you to list your business’ location online and offline. This service is free of charge. Using local SEO lets a business establish their company name and brand with local customers in the online world. The Google Maps application service that was recently launched by Google benefits businesses around the world with local SEO. One of the goals of any business is to identify with their local market. Online sales are fantastic but if you can really content to a local market, your sales will increase astronomically. In order to do this, though, local customers need to know your business, and that is something that local SEO can help with. These local SEO techniques are geared towards helping your website show up when people search for a local business. By using the Google Maps application, you can target certain customers who can then identify your location, your product and/or service, and any other relevant information they may need. There are a few viable ways to use local SEO to optimize your site. As mentioned, Google Maps is one of the best tools to use to improve your local brand, and getting set up with them takes about a month, so you should get started on that. With that being said, other search engines such as Yahoo do not have such an extensive procedure, and they will definitely help your cause as well. Getting listed with local directories will help as well, as this will not only help people find you locally but also improve your search engine ranking – the more links back to your site, the better! Pages like Yellow Pages, Yelp, Yellow Book, and True Local are all great business directories you should ensure your business is listed in. Explode SEO can optimize your local SEO efforts. One of the most important parts of search engine optimization is ensuring each of the pages of your website are totally optimized otherwise the local SEO efforts might be slightly wasted. Explode SEO can help you with your website optimization, and your local SEO efforts by placing your company information in countless local directories, and listing your company information on numerous search engines. Their diligence, commitment and insurmountable knowledge of the search engine optimization industry will help get your company the exposure and visibility it needs to be successful.

In order to succeed as a company, you normally need a presence both online and offline, and with local SEO you can use one to support the other, and vice versa. Using Explode SEO to improve your local efforts will definitely pay off as you start to build up your company’s brand. Request a Quote!
